# Simple Gatsby SEO test

This is a simple site to test various features and implementations and how they affect SEO. For example, images, scripts, redux, etc.

## Testing Methodology

The first test will be to establish a baseline for a simple site with no images, scripts, etc.

### Master Branch

The master branch will serve as the test of the most recent version of the site where all features are enabled.

### Baseline

The baseline branch will be a simple site with no images, scripts, etc. The only thing it will have is a single page with some text.
